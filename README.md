# ContosoUniversity
Contoso University sample re-done the way I would build it

NOTES: 

Your connection string for Local DB may need to be changed depending on your version on your box.

Integration tests included to show how I would do it using RoundHouse for example (https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse).  Sample does not need this.  Sample is setup to run using EF CF migrations for your ease of getting the sample running.
